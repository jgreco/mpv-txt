# Number of threads to use for text-to-speech processing.

#        The ebook-convert tool from Calibre is used to convert ebooks to txt
#        documents.  Many common and obscure input formats are supported, see:
#        https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/generated/en/ebook-convert.html
#        for more info.
#
#        For this to work ebook-convert should be in your PATH.  On MacOS
#        mpv-txt also looks for ebook-convert in the following locations:
#            /Applications/calibre.app/Contents/MacOS/ebook-convert
#            ~/Applications/calibre.app/Contents/MacOS/ebook-convert

# EXPERIMENTAL!
# If enabled, a text editor will be launched with xterm to cleanup the
# output of Calibre for ebook conversions before it's run through TTS.
#
#  Note: $EDITOR will be used if set, otherwise nano.

# Display a progress bar during TTS generation.  Particularly handy for long
